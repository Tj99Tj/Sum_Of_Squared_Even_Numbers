# Sum_Of_Squared_Even_Numbers
* An assignment I was given in Introduction to Programming, we were given the following task
  * the user is asked to input a number N;
  * the sum of the squared *even* numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) is computed and output to the screen;
  * the user is asked if they want to compute a new sum of squared numbers, and if yes the program goes back to 1.
